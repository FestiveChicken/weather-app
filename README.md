# 🌤️ Weather App

A simple weather forecast app that lets you search for any city or town and displays the current temperature and conditions. This was my first time working with APIs, built as a quick exercise to get comfortable using API requests in JavaScript.

## 🔗 Live Demo  
[Click here to try the app](https://festivechicken.github.io/weather-app/)

## 🛠️ Features
- Search for weather by city name
- Displays temperature and conditions using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- Clean, user-friendly interface
- Basic error handling
- Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## 📸 How It Works

1. Enter the name of a city or town in the search bar.
2. The app fetches and displays current weather information.

## ⚠️ Note
This project used a free-trial API key which may no longer be active.

## 📚 Assignment Summary
This project was part of an assignment to practice:
- Consuming external APIs
- Handling asynchronous JavaScript with promises or `async/await`
- Dynamically updating the DOM based on data
- Basic API key awareness and client-side limitations

Optional goals included:
- Toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Updating UI based on weather conditions
- Using dynamic image content (e.g., Giphy API for weather GIFs)
- Adding a loading state during API calls
