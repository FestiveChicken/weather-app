# Weather App

# Description
This project is my first time ever using APIs! This was a very quick project in comparison to the other ones I have been doing and it is simply practice for me to use an API. This project uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
# Live Project
The project is live and can be accessed [here](https://festivechicken.github.io/weather-app/)

# How to Use the Project
To use the following project is extremely simple.
1. Just type in the city or town where you want to get the weather from into the search box

2. And the app will tell you the weather and temperature at that place!
3.
